# To-Do List App

A responsive To-Do List application enabling users to add, complete, and delete tasks. Data persists via localStorage.

## How It Works
- Add Task: Enter text and press the Add button (or Enter key).
- Complete Task: Click the checkbox next to a task.
- Delete Task: Click the delete icon next to a task.
- Persistence: All tasks are saved to browser storage and reloaded on page visit.

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open index.html in a browser.

## Future Enhancements
- Edit existing tasks inline.
- Filter by status (All / Active / Completed).
- Drag-and-drop reordering.
- Dark/light theme toggle.
